# Stick It to the (Stick) Man

This is a VERY fun and satisfying game. Basically, you go around beating up stick figures.

This game will probably not work on low-end computers without graphics changes.

# Recommended Settings

Since this game is pretty heavy on a low-end PC, you might need to change some graphics settings.

Here are my recommended settings:

1. Select the ```I have a weak PC``` option in the main menu
2. Disable motion blur
3. Set screen resolution to ```720x480```
